# Next.js Image Import Error: Importing images outside the public directory
This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications where images are imported from paths relative to the `pages` directory but not placed in the `public` directory. This leads to a runtime error when rendering the page containing the `img` tag.

## Description
The issue arises when an image is directly imported into a component without placing the image in the `public` folder.  This is because Next.js uses a specific directory structure for static assets, and images outside the `public` folder will not be correctly served.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You will see an error in your browser console regarding the image import.

## Solution
Move the image to the `public` directory and adjust the `src` attribute of the `img` tag to reflect the new path.
